A simple visual interface made with Java Swing.

It is my very first Java project I made outside of school, and used to learn about Swing and GUIs.
It's basically some sort of video game menu, where you arrive at a start menu, and by clicking inside the window, then on the buttons, you go into other menus.
I might make another version of this, more polished and asthetically pleasing to see.
